# pura
Pura helps you clean chemical and reaction data. Right now, you can use it to resolve common chemical names (e.g., aspirin) to standard cheminformatics identifiers like SMILES.

You can now access pura using our [web app](https://moleculeresolver.streamlit.app/)!


## Installation

```bash
pip install pura
```

## Resolve compound identifiers

Compounds are often recorded as common names instead of a machine readable identifier like SMILES.

There are several services that can do name resolution (PubChem, Chemical Identity Resolver, ChemSpider), and they sometimes disagree. Pura enables you to check several services asynchronously and ensure that a certain number agree on the resolved identifier. You can then discard or manually check the names that could not be resolved.

You can find a full list of services [here](https://github.com/sustainable-processes/pura/tree/main/pura/services).

```python
# Import pura
from pura.resolvers import resolve_identifiers
from pura.compound import CompoundIdentifierType
from pura.services import PubChem, CIR, CAS

# Resolve names to SMILES
resolved = resolve_identifiers(
    ["Josiphos SL-J001-1", "Rh(NBD)2BF4", "DuPhos"],
    input_identifer_type=CompoundIdentifierType.NAME,
    output_identifier_type=CompoundIdentifierType.SMILES,
    backup_identifier_types=[
        CompoundIdentifierType.INCHI_KEY,
        CompoundIdentifierType.CAS_NUMBER,
    ],
    services=[PubChem(autocomplete=True), CIR(), CAS()],
    agreement=1,
    silent=True,
)
print("\nResults\n")
for input_compound, resolved_identifiers in resolved:
    print(input_compound, resolved_identifiers, "\n")
#Josiphos SL-J001-1 [CompoundIdentifier(identifier_type=<CompoundIdentifierType.SMILES: 2>, #value='C1CCCC1.CC(C1CCCC1P(c1ccccc1)c1ccccc1)P(C1CCCCC1)C1CCCCC1.[Fe]', details=None)]

# Rh(NBD)2BF4 [CompoundIdentifier(identifier_type=<CompoundIdentifierType.SMILES: 2>, value='C1=CC2C=CC1C2.C1=CC2C=CC1C2.F[B-](F)(F)F.[Rh]', details=None)]

# Dichloro(p-cymene)ruthenium(II) dimer [CompoundIdentifier(identifier_type=<CompoundIdentifierType.SMILES: 2>, value='Cc1ccc(C(C)C)cc1.Cc1ccc(C(C)C)cc1.Cl[Ru]Cl.Cl[Ru]Cl', details=None)]

# DuPhos [CompoundIdentifier(identifier_type=<CompoundIdentifierType.SMILES: 2>, value='CC(C)C1CCC(C(C)C)P1c1ccccc1P1C(C(C)C)CCC1C(C)C', details=None)]
```

## Development

<!-- ### Roadmap -->

<!-- ### Getting set up -->

1. Install poetry using the following or via the instructions [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation):

    ```bash
    curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python -
    ```

2. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sustainable-processes/pura.git
    cd pura
    ```

3. Install the dependencies from `poetry.lock`:

    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

    Once you make some changes, commit and push:

    ```bash
    git commit -am <YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE>
    git push
    ```
